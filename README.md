# Metta Language Support

This extension provides Syntax Auto-Formatting, Highlighting, Linting, Hovering, Snippet, Folding and File-Icon only for the Metta programming language.

## Instructions

- Install the extension 
- If your code base is only in metta, Set Color Theme provided by the extension
- To change between themes press: `CTR + SHIFT + P`, search for color theme and click, then choose Dark Modern or Metta Theme.
- I don't recommend setting file icon theme provided by the extension since it currently doesn't support other file types rather than metta.

## Features

- Document Auto-formatting for Metta files by pressing CTR + S or if auto-save mode is enabled it will auto-format your file
- Syntax highlighting for Metta language
- Hovering for more detail on keys
- Linting for Error handling
- Snippets to give you starter
- Folding to make you code cleaner
- Custom file icon for `.metta` files (I only added 1 icon for MeTTa. I will add others later if necessary)
- Simple Refactor with ctr + shift + R
- More Features will be added. You can also contribute for more features.
